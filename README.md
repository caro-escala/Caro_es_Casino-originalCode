In this project I developed a game of chances, like a virtual slot machine hosted in "my Casino". The purpose of it was to train React development tools and start to use "states" in the components. The page wasn't though to be responsive. I coded the effects myself, by using different class styles, event listener and setting time-outs.

I hope you enjoy it :)
